# Problem 6 - Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1ˆ2 + 2ˆ2 + ... + 10ˆ2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)ˆ2 = 55ˆ2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
